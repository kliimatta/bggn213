## Q1 3 : Read this file into R and determine the sample size for each genotype and their corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes.

How many samples do we have?

``` r
expr <- read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt")
head(expr)
```

       sample geno      exp
    1 HG00367  A/G 28.96038
    2 NA20768  A/G 20.24449
    3 HG00361  A/A 31.32628
    4 HG00135  A/A 34.11169
    5 NA18870  G/G 18.25141
    6 NA11993  A/A 32.89721

``` r
nrow(expr)
```

    [1] 462

``` r
table(expr$geno)
```


    A/A A/G G/G 
    108 233 121 

### The sample size for genotype A/A, A/G, and G/G are 108, 233, and 121, respectively.

``` r
library(ggplot2)
```

letâ€™s make a boxplot

``` r
box <- ggplot(expr) + aes(x=geno, y=exp, fill=geno) +
  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE) 
box
```

![](class11_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)

``` r
AA <- subset(expr, geno=="A/A")
median(AA$exp)
```

    [1] 31.24847

``` r
AG <- subset(expr, geno=="A/G")
median(AG$exp)
```

    [1] 25.06486

``` r
GG <- subset(expr, geno=="G/G")
median(GG$exp)
```

    [1] 20.07363

### The median expression levels for A/A, A/G, and G/G are 31.2, 25.1, and 20.1, respectively.

## Q1 4 : Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the expression of ORMDL3?

### Boxplot:

``` r
box
```

![](class11_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

### A/A is associated with significantly higher expression of ORMDL3. The SNP does affect the expression of ORMDL3.
